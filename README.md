In the pursuit of renewable energy solutions, our project focuses on leveraging piezoelectric and force to generate power from vibrations and direct force. Through dedicated research and development efforts, we have engineered a system capable of converting mechanical energy into electrical power and storing it for subsequent use.
Our journey towards the final release has been characterised by iterative refinement and learning. The initial alpha release provided valuable insights, revealing the need for optimization, particularly in enhancing power generation efficiency through a greater number of . This phase served as a foundation for understanding the complexities of piezoelectric energy harvesting and refining our approach accordingly.
Building upon the lessons learned from the alpha release, the development of our final release represents a notable step forward in capability and performance. By increasing the number of , we have improved the pace of power generation, albeit within limitations that surfaced during testing. This enhancement holds promise for applications with moderate power demands.
A notable achievement in our final release is the capability to charge a higher voltage battery, expanding the potential applications of the system. Integration of an active transformer has further elevated the output voltage, albeit within constraints that emerged during testing, reaching levels between 210 to 220 volts. However, despite these advancements, the system still faces challenges in fulfilling higher current requirements, limiting its ability to generate ample power.
The implications of our project extend beyond technological innovation to encompass the exploration of sustainable energy sources. By tapping into mechanical energy from ambient sources, we aim to offer an alternative to traditional power generation methods. However, we acknowledge the current limitations in meeting higher power demands.
Moving forward, our focus remains on enhancing the efficiency, reliability, and scalability of piezoelectric energy harvesting technology. We recognize the need for further optimizations to address current limitations and are committed to exploring new avenues for integration and application.
In conclusion, our project represents progress in the field of energy harvesting, albeit with an awareness of the limitations and challenges encountered. While our final release demonstrates advancements in certain aspects of power generation and storage, it also underscores the need for continued innovation and refinement to realise the full potential of piezoelectric in driving sustainable energy solutions
